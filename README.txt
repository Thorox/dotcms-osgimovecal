Workflow OSGI plugin to move one message from pubic data form into new event structure using workflow button in dotCMS.

To implement install OSGI plugin then add new workflow to structure 1 which will move data into structure 2.
We use this functionality to move public submitted forms into a published structure for calendar events after review.
This maintains the posted data and unpublished and separate from the live data to avoid any problems with submitted data (spam, etc).
